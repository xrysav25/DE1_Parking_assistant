### LED bargaph module
For LED visualization we have chosem bargraph with 10 LEDs and segments with diferent colors, as can be seen below.

|*Example of used bargraph[1]*|

Its first segment is blue which will represent ON/OFF state indication. Other segments represent actual distance ranging from green to red. For the actual bargraph we have designed small module board, that will conect to Arty board through 2 Pmod connectors.

|*Model of designed board*|

Board is fitted with bargraph itself, liminig resistors and 2 pinheader blocks. Board was designed in Autodesk EAGLE.

## VHDL modules description and simulations

### LED bargaph module
LED module takes 2 inputs and has 1 output. One of the inputs is enable signal, which determines if module can function or not. Second input is distance level represented by 4-bit std logic vecotr. Output is 10-bit std logic vector for bargraph itself.
Architecture is represented by by single ```p_led_driver``` combiational process with both inputs in its sensitivity list. First it checks, if enable signal is ON or OFF. If enable is OFF, it will switch off all the LEDs and if it is ON it will continue to determine value of distance level and will light up the LEDs accordingly.
#### Code for module
```vhdl

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity led_driver is
    Port ( 
    en_i                 : in   std_logic;
    distance_i           : in   std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
    
    leds_o               : out  std_logic_vector(10 - 1 downto 0)
    );
end led_driver;

architecture Behavioral of led_driver is
